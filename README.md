# Regression Predictive Modeling

## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that is able to accurately estimate the price of the house with given features. I got the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices "LCO"). This Dataset consist several features such as Number of Rooms, Crime Rate, pupil-reacher ratio by town and Tax and so on.


This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You will also need Jupyter Notebook installed to run and execute.

## Code
Template code is provided in the `houseprice_prediction.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included the `HousingData.csv` dataset file to complete your work.
